  <p>Following are the great tips on how to begins your photography journey. These are the
    tips that helps me get over my photography mistakes. </p>
  <h2>1. Master your Phone Camera.</h2>
  <p>Beginners can use their phone to capture
    the best scene. All you need is to capture more
    amount of pictures and show them to your friends and try to get their
    feedback because feedback is the most important key to fix your mistakes.

  <h2>2. Buy Camera in your Budget.</h2>
  <p>Going for the expensive camera at the beginning isnot worthed. You can find
    lots of camera under $800 which is better for taking photos.

  <h2>3. Get a Tripod.</h2>
  <p>If you have a shacky hand then getting a tripod is great ideas. Tripod basically helps
    to prevent the camera movement and gives you a better stability for taking photos. I do not
    have shacky hand but when I go for 300mm lens then tripod is a great help. </p>
  <h2>4. Keep your Camera with you all the Time.</h2>
  <p>Photo ops often come when you least expect it. If you can keep your equipment relatively
    simple – just a small camera bag and a tripod – you might be able to take advantage of some of those unexpected opportunities. Or, if your phone has a
    camera, use it to take “notes” on scenes you’d like to return to with your regular camera.
